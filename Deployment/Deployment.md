> Note: This deployment assumes you have created a [Twiter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) with "Elevated" access to the Twitter API's features (check out this [link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api) for more info on the access levels) and a [News API account](https://newsapi.org/).

### **Configuring the ARM template**
In order to deploy the secrets into the Azure Key Vault, we need to configure the following variables.

![Azure Key Vault deployment](./img/KeyVaultDeployment.png "Azure Key Vault Deployment")

 > The Twitter API keys and tokens (4-7) can be obtained in your [Twiter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) 
4. **Twitter API Key**
5. **Twitter API Secret Key**
6. **Twitter Access Token**
7. **Twitter Access Token Secret**

8. **News API Key**: can be obtained from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/)
9. **Text Analytics Key**: The key for your Text Analytics resource that was created in previous steps 
10. **Text Analytics Endpoint**: The endpoint for your Text Analytics resource that was created in previous steps 
11. **Text Analytics Region**: The region your Text Analytics resouce is in

### Step 3.2: Add your IP address to Synapse firewall
Before you can upload assets to the Synapse Workspace you will need to add your IP address:
1. Go to the Synapse resouce you created in the previous step. 
2. Navigate to `Networking` under `Security` on the left hand side of the page.
3. At the middle of the screen click `+ Add client IP`
    ![Update Firewalls](./img/deploy-firewall.png)  
4. Your IP address should now be visible in the IP list

### Step 3.3: Update storage account permisions 
In order to perform the necessary actions in Synapse workspace, you will need to grant more access.
1. Go to the Azure Data Lake Storage Account for your Synapse Workspace
2. Go to the `Access Control (IAM) > + Add > Add role assignment` 
3. Now search and select the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role and click "Next" 
4. Click "+ Select members", search and select your username and click "Select" 
5. Click `Review and assign` at the bottom

5. Click `...` on the deployed Spark Pool and select `Packages`
6. Click `Upload` and select [requirements.txt](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Social-Media-Analytics-Solution-Accelerator/blob/main/Code/requirements.txt) from the cloned repo.
7. Click `Apply`
![upload requirements](./img/Requirements.png)

### Step 4.2: Create Key Vault Linked Service 
1. Launch the Synapse workspace [Synapse Workspace](https://ms.web.azuresynapse.net/)
2. Select the `subscription` and `workspace` name you are using for this solution accelerator
3. Navigate to the `Manage` Hub, under "External connection" click `Linked services`
